## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Sivas Cumhuriyet University. While taking basic-level Java courses at university, I completed my 2023 summer internship in Web Frontend at Cumhuriyet Teknokent. During this time, I gained skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git & GitHub usage.
